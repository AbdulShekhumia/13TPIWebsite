# Global Climate Vision Web Application
Welcome to the developed web-based application created for Global Climate Vision. This software has been produced as an asessment for NCEA Digital Technologies Level 3 standards. Global Climate Vision is a fictional organization that have created for this project's development. Please note, this is a school assessment and I have fairly used media for following copyright licenses. I utilized different sorts of complex programming techniques for the 3.7 –AS91906 standard. As well asused complex techniques to develop a database complying with the 3.3 -AS91902 standard.I also developed a digital media outcome (3.4 AS91903) as promotional material for this fictional organization. All of these were integrated within and alongside the web application as a whole. I present you to a project that has specifically been created for a user-friendly experience.

## Description
The purpose of this web application is topromote this new design and attract the audience to interact with the website. This will allow to receive useful information about climate change giving them a better grasp of understanding and figuring out ways to support the cause. Climate change is an issue caused by greenhouse gas emissions that could affect the future if left unnoticed, so this is a great way to spread awareness to different sorts of people. I have designed this to engage end-users who may not have the highest attention-span, griping themandallowing them to be interested withthe user interface.
